# YOLOv5 Manhole Detection with Flask

Detecting manholes on roads is crucial for urban planning, maintenance, and safety. This project utilizes the YOLOv5 deep learning framework to accurately identify manholes in images, coupled with a Flask web application for easy deployment and integration into existing systems.

# Features

Manhole Detection: Utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, to accurately detect manholes in images.

Flask Web Application: Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing detection results in real-time.

Efficient Deployment: Designed for easy deployment, allowing seamless integration into existing systems or standalone usage.

Scalability: Can be scaled to handle large datasets and real-time video streams for continuous monitoring.

Getting Started
